# How Much Have Tech Companies Grown
## Problem Statement:
We wanted to figure out how big tech companies actually are. We did this by looking at various companies’ revenue and stock value. We chose to examine Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix.
## Why is this interesting?
This is interesting because it shows how big an everyday company is and how much control they have in the tech industry. This might also be helpful to those who want to find a good company to invest in.
## What data have you looked at and why this data answers the question?
First, we looked at each company’s revenue on macrotrends.com. They provided yearly revenue from the early 2000s to 2020. Then, we downloaded chart data from NASDAQ and graphed it, as can be seen in the next slide
## Conclusions from the data:
The first graph is a chart showing stock values from January 2nd to August 25th for Facebook. The second graph shows stock values from January 2nd to August 25th for Apple. The third graph compared the highest revenue for Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix. The comparison is in millions of USD.
## What you learned:
Based of the work we made on the differents data of the 6 companies we were focused on which are Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft,  and Google.
We found that Amazon has the highest revenue of income in 2019. 
We learned how to use python program to analysis our data using the tool named repl.it to make our coding and showcase our final result on GitHub. We finalized all the data collected in a graph made with python.
